# Three.js Minecraft

This three.js minecraft game was built using [HritikRC's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/c/HritikRC) on youtube.

I've attempted to refactor the code using ES6 classes although whilst the code now lives in different files, it's not much tidier and hasn't reduced the complexity very much.

Built using Three.js, perlin noise and webpack

## How to run

`yarn` to install, and `yarn dev` runs the development server for the application
